* Example Games
    * Atomic Chess
        * Whenever a piece is taken, all pieces (for either player) except pawns within a one square radius of the capture square are taken off the board.
    * 4 Way Chess
        * Modified board where 3 rows of squares are added to the each side (so 8 by 8 in the middle, no corners)
        * each player has all normal pieces lined up on the 4 edges, and 8 6 squares forward from the pawns is the queening square for that team.
        * Game is point based, same rules about checking, but anyone can attack anyone and any takes adds points to your overall score
        * highest score wins
    * Crazy House
        * Like normal chess, but a player can place in a piece that they have previously captured to any square as a move (pawns can only be placed on rows 2-7)
    * Gravity Chess
        * Like normal chess, but pieces must always be pressed against the bottom of the board (so if you play 1. e4, the pawn would go sliding down to h4 because no pieces held it up to e4, and all the pawns it had supported would slide down a square)
